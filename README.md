# Final project

### The objective of this project is to analyze health habits and indicators of Chicago's population between 2014-2020.

### Data
Data related to health indicators and restaurants were both extracted from official sources, the [Chicago Atlas Health](https://chicagohealthatlas.org/).
and the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).

### Processing/cleaning the dataset:
In order to obtain the number of restaurants, we downloaded the data of restaurant inspections in Chicago. This is a proof that the restaurant exists during the year in which the inspection has been done.

## Deliverables
